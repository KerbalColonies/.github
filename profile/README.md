## Main

KerbalColonies is an open-source project that adds colonies to Kerbal Space Program 1 (KSP1) using Kerbal Konstructs.

The project consists of two main components:

1. Kerbal Colonies Core
The core plugin that provides all essential functionality for managing and interacting with colonies.

2. Kerbal Colonies Configs
A collection of configuration files that define the actual colony sites, buildings, and gameplay elements. These require the Core to function!
